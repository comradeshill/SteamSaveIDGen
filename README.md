# SteamSaveIDGen
Steam ID Generator for carrying over save files

Simple tool for generating a Steam ID that matches a downloaded/old save game.

Working in Shadow of War, would work in other games that use the same encryption method for generating a save ID (idk which ones, try it lol).

## THIS WILL NOT CONVERT YOUR SAVE FILE IN ANY WAY. YOU CANNOT USE THIS FOR CONVERTING FROM A PIRATED COPY > STEAM.

# Usage

**1. Input your 8 digit save ID from your save file**

  eg. For Shadow of War, this will be the file located at C:\Users\[you]\AppData\Local\WB Games\Shadow of War\, and will look something like "00000666_ShadowOfWar".
  Copy the 8 digit number from the start of the file, and enter it into the program.
  
 **2. Copy your newly generated ID into settings**
 
 This will vary depending on the Steam emu your game is using. 
 Recent versions of Shadow of War use Goldberg, and save games/settings are located at C:\Users\[you]\AppData\Roaming\Goldberg SteamEmu Saves\356190.
 Create a settings subdirectory in that folder, and copy the steam_user_id.txt generated by this program to that folder.
 
 **3. Copy your save game and enjoy!**
